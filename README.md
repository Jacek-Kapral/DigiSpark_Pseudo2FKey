# DigiSpark Hardware Password Key
### A very simple, hardware password key for people who don't want to remember their password manager credentials ;)

Some time ago I've bought myself some electronics to experiment with, having in mind a few simple projects,
like moisture meter for inhouse plants, door peephole camera and others. 
One of those gizmos was a small microcontroller - Digistump DigiSpark ATtiny85, for which I initially had
something other in mind (I'm going to describe that later), but came up with an idea that would make 
the need to use a password manager software my girlfriend's "digital" life easier - and a bit safer - 
since she's not really convinced to use it because of long and complicated password needed to unlock
the database (which frankly was my suggestion).

<b>I'll point the obvious right away</b>: This is not a secure solution and is intended to use at home.
I'm very aware that passwords are <u>not</u> stored in a secure way, besides, using the thingy reveals stored
passwords. 
The idea is to *lessen the burden* of using password manager secured with complicated password.
If You loose this thing somewhere in public, consider Your password / database compromised,
even though without proper context it is not very useful.

The setup (at least on Windoze) is a bit troublesome, in my opinion it's not that worth of a hassle,
on the other hand, there aren't many microcontroller development boards with usb plug on board, 
most of them have either micro usb or usb-c port.
